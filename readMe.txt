Notes:
There are two programs
master.out 
slave.out

How To Use:
1) run "./docker_run.sh" - it will run both dockers in order.

Usege 
Option 1 must come first (so there will be a DB to work with)

attacments:
bash script - "get_stocks_data.sh"
stocks data.
3 .cpp / .h programs 
one me - the readMe.

Please forgive us for a minor bug, there is an unexpected behavior to the fetching script only when its inside the docker,
sometime it won't fatch the stock, therefore we attached a stock of our own.
sorry for the inconvenience we ask for your appreciation for the effort we put on the other system components.

Thanks for the course, we gained a lot of knowledge and experience from it.
